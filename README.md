Legends of Equestria Private Server
===================================

This is a Private Server, to play LoE even when the official servers are closed.

How to use :
Extract in the Legends of Equestria folder, start PrivateServer.exe, then in the game use the server Loopback.
The server should work on Linux and Mac too, but you'll need to compile it yourself.

The private server is still in beta, and some important features are lacking :

- Some places (Tartarus, Twilight's Library,..) are not accessible without using the server commands.
- No skills (no unicorn magic) except flying for pegasi.
- No monsters or NPCs without server commands.
- No chat.
- No quests.
