=> Since I'm a faggot, I'll make my own NPC script and interpreter :
==> Filenames should be XXName where XX is id of the quest. Not mandatory.
==> Have a quest struct wich remembers qstringlist of commands, quest id/name/descr/state and EIP. Each player has a copy
==> EIP should be reset everytime you start a new conversation with a NPC. Don't resume from the last time.
=> Lines starting with # are comments. No midline comments tho.

Special variables. Use these in a 'say' or 'answer' command :
$PLAYERNAME - Name of the player's pony

An 'answer' should always be following a 'say' or another 'answer'.
When reaching a 'say', we send the say and all the answers under it, then wait until the client clicks/answers.
If a 'say' has no answers, we still send it and wait until the client clicks to continue.

And I cannot stress this enough, quest IDs MUST be unique. 
If they aren't, somes NPCs may have their scripts mixed up and share the same save, with unexpected consequences.
If you want to add new NPCs, you should give them a high quest ID from the start (e.g. 50 and onward), 
so that they won't conflict with the private server's 'official' NPCs even in later updates.

It's a bad idea to create a player with the same name as a NPC.
This will confuse the game, and might break the chat and quests for this player until the name is changed.

List of emotions (emotionId), used with the 'sayIcon' command. 
This will only work if there is an actual avatar corresponding to the given emotion and NPC name.
At the moment, there are only avatars for the main NPCs and only certain emotions.
The avatars/icons are in the file resources.assets of the game client.
